Rebellion Developments, Monolith Productions, Third Law Interactive / Компьютерные игры, 1999-2010. Valzu, supervisor to the Smithhammers, enters and proceeds towards the mission board, speaking the whole way. "This one is important fella's. We have sent two supply convoys north to the logging camp over the past week, neither one has arrived. We need a few lad's or lasses.or whatever you are to get to the bottom of this. It's important that our supply lines stay safe for travel so we will be taking anyone with a little more dirt under their fingers. The party as of Sep 30th, 9:00am Karrion. I recently bought both of these commander standard decks and having a lot of fun finetuning them. Do you guys have any recommendations for cards that would be great with these commanders? I'm a reletive newbie so any advice would by higly appreciated. welcome all beginner and expert. 
We are Claws of Defiance! We are a clan that excel in both PvP and PvE! Right now we have a good group of solid Destiny players for all assets of the game, but we are looking to expand our horizon and make new friends to help us on our adventures! We are looking for sweats in both PvP and PvE. We will be checking stats but that isn’t the only thing we look at while reviewing an application so don’t be afraid to contact us. Direct message me if you are interested for more details.  This is it, ladies and gentlemen - it's Embargo Lift Day on the brand new Warhammer 2 DLC! As always, I'm putting together a bit of a compilation in the hopes of keeping things organized - I'll be adding more links to videos, streams, and articles as I come across them. If you have any that I missed, please let me know in the comments! Mods - feel free to sticky, edit, remove, or do whatever you deem necessary to this thread. I'll try and stay on top of this throughout the day with updates. In case you're lazy like me (I say, having typed this all up) and don't wanna go between both the Steam page and the FAQ page. DLC: \- Two new lords, Tehenhauin and Ikit Claw \- Two new factions, Clan Skryre and the Cult of Sotek \- Nine new units; three Skaven, six Lizardmen \- Sixteen new Regiments of Renown with eight for each race, with an additional five unlockable for the Skaven in campaign (ala the Tomb Kings' Legions of Legend) \- Two new generic lord types. #Buried Debts: Update 24.4.0 Source (https://forums.warframe.com/topic/1067397-buried-debts-update-2440/) Redtext (https://i.redd.it/4h92yp99zsk21.png) Image ( >The first Mainline Update of 2019 has arrived! A massive amount of fixes, changes, additions and more have been collected since our last Mainline (The Profit-Taker) and splayed below for you! Sometimes WIP features slip through the cracks and launch. Copy pasting this directly from a small rant on the discord about female representation in Warhammer/other games. Apologies for spur of the moment formatting. Can I just bitch for a minute about how any time I mention how female representation would be neat in X thing, everyone assumes I mean I want bikini warrior maaturbation material? "It makes sense people want female space marines. That'd be hot, and people want to get their rocks off. I'm on board." that guy always appears "Let the fools come after me, one after another, an endless line of eager assassins," Entreri said, and he nodded again. "With each kill, I grow wiser, and with added wisdom, I grow stronger." # Artemis Entreri (https://i.imgur.com/oM37BSp.png) ###This is a literary Respect Thread.

Hey Guys and Gals, I'm sure I'm not alone in loving the flavor of WAR, but also feeling a bit starved for content and context. Having to wait another two weeks for the novel is killing me, and while I think the cards do a pretty good job of telling the story, I really want more. I want to know how the Sorin Nahiri fight went, I want to know how Chandra fights Dovin, I want to know how the boar god comes to be and how it fights and what side the Gruul Good day beautiful community, i do this post, asking for the first time because I need help. I have received a ban on my account for the alleged crime of rwt (real world trading). My name is Alejandro and my RSN: s1 rang nylo. This morning I was banned without the right to appeal with 2b-2.5b bank, I have done a few exchanges with split to cox/tob, I changed the desktop (1 month-3 months ago) and many photos were lost. I have some photos of my account in my new desk. All the trade Hello arena players, In the past week we’ve been hard at work rating the 135 Rise of Shadow cards that will be in the arena. As with previous expansions, a team of leaderboard-level players took days to rate the cards individually, followed by hours of group discussions with the goal to set a single tierlist score for every card. It’s a joined effort and we hope that by putting so much arena experience together, we can minimize bias and the amount of misses that are so common during card evalua. >be me; LizarDM >be not me; lizardfolk fighter, lizardfolk cleric, lizardfolk paladin, drow rogue and kobold bard >the party, having escaped captivity from the drow are now concentrating on stopping the Forged God before it makes its way to the swamp and destroys it >the party wake up after resting for the night, the bard tucked close to the fighter’s chest >the cleric chews a leaf and after a moment, nods >he walks into the trees and holds out his hand >he waits littl. These are all capable of taking games between 10-5 where I tested them. Although they are not ordered, generally the ones I feel better about are closer to the top and the worst ones are at the bottom. If you want to know why there is no priest list, it's because it's my worst class and I have no idea what to do with it even under ideal circumstances. Sorry. ### RoS Budget Tempo Mage 2 x Sorcerer's Apprentice ( 2 x Frostbol.
